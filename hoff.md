title: Python Companion to "A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods"
---

This is meant to contain snippets of python code as a companion to the Peter D. Hoff book "A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods."

Here we have the first example from Chapter 3 Section 3.1.2. In the script below we have an example of sampling from a Binomial distribution with a uniform prior. The script in question provides the 95% confidence intervals.

Later in Chapter 3 Hoff looks at this same procedure for comparing poisson distributions.
